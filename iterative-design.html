      <br>
      <p class = "section-text-font">Bananas is a grocery delivery startup based in Jakarta, Indonesia where you can order groceries and get it delivered in minutes.
        Its aim is to deliver groceries directly to user’s home within minutes and at supermarket prices. You can find more details from its <a href = "https://www.bananas.id/" target = "_blank">website</a>.
      </p>
      <p class = "section-text-font">
        In this project, our group will go through the full process of mocking up a solution to the Bananas's concept and design a mobile interactive interface for it.

      <h3 class = "intro text-center">Initial Sketches</h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "section-text-font">
        At the first stage, we brainstormed 4 different possible designs for Bananas's mobile app which are shown below.
        Each team member designed the initial sketch by himself/herself, in order to reflect as wide a variety of screens and layouts as possible to get the ideas flowing.

      <h3 class = "intro text-center">Combined Wireframe</h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "section-text-font">
        After we have finished initial sketches, we combined our ideas and made one set of wireframes to show how we’ve incorporated that feedback into the next iteration of our design.
        The wireframe is shown below.
      </p>

      <figure style = "padding-top: 10px;">

      <h3 class = "intro text-center">Interactive Hi-Fi Mockup</h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "section-text-font">
        At this stage, we made an interactive high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype based on the wireframe we created.
        After we presented our mockup during the studio time, we received a round of critiques shown as below:
      </p>

      <ul class = "section-text-font">
        <li>Navigation bar should be accessible in the checkout page.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">Some buttons are too small to click on.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">In the order history page, the reorder button is too large, which is very strange.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">In the account setting page, title looks clickable, which shouldn't be.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">In the checkout page, there is no way to return back to the home page, should add a return button.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class = "section-text-font">
        After critique, we made a final iteration to our high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype incorporating the feedback, which can be found <a href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/VtwY6Bo4ZhMcSTni5zSA31/Banana-mobile-app?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2" target = "_blank">here</a>.
        And there are also some screenshots from our final prototype as shown below.

      <h3 class = "intro text-center">User Testing</h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "section-text-font">
        At this stage, we conducted our own usability test through a remote user testing service (<a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target = "_blank">UserTesting.com</a>), using our final interactive Hi-Fi prototype.
        We provided testing instructions, some specific tasks as well as post-test questions to collect information from <b>three users</b>.

          Bananas is an App for grocery delivery. Imagine you are looking to buy some groceries using the Bananas mobile app. Note that you will be interacting with a mockup made through prototyping software, rather than an actual mobile app. Not all buttons are clickable and input fields are not interactive. However, everything you need to complete the specified tasks (i.e. the main flow to buy grocery and checkout) has been built and can be reached by navigating through the app. Please ignore if the grocery product information is incorrect or not matched. Please think out loud as you perform the specified tasks.

        <p><b>Feedback: Users find it very easy to view items in the shopping cart. In line with our expectations. Some users suggest to add the total number of items on the shopping cart button.</b></p>

        <li>Proceed to the checkout page and view the order summary.</li>
        <p><b>Feedback: Users find it very easy to view order summary. In line with our expectations. Some users suggest to add tip options in percentage, and add a “Order Summary” title at the top to notify user that she/he is viewing the summary.</b></p>

        <li>Place the order, reorder or return to the order history to view all your orders.</li>
        <p><b>Feedback: Users find it very easy to place the order, reorder and view the order history. In line with our expectations.</b></p>

      <p class = "section-text-font">
        Overall, users find that all tasks are very easy to complete, and they completed them successfully without making mistakes. In terms of learnability, all users find it very simple to learn and use.
      </p>

      <p class = "section-text-font">
        From the results and feedbacks, there are several potential interface changes we would make:
      </p>

      <ol class = "section-text-font">
        <li>Lower the brightness of the yellow color.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">Limit the length of product description in the product detail page.</li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">Change the “Confirm” button to “Add” button in the product detail page.</li>
